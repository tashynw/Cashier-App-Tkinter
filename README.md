# Cashier-App-Tkinter
An app that allows a store owner/cashier to add their items to the database. They can then click the name of the items to sum their prices. The program also allows the user to input the customer's money to calculate change. Made with Tkinter with ttkbootstrap, database managed by sqlite3. Expect updates coming soon regarding a cleaner design!
