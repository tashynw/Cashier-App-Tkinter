VIDEO PREVIEW: https://vimeo.com/653213379

An app that allows a store owner/cashier to add their items to the database. They can then click the name of the items to sum their prices. The program also allows the user to input the customer's money to calculate change and to round its value. Made with Tkinter with ttkbootstrap, database managed by sqlite3. Expect updates coming soon regarding a cleaner design! 

If insterested in using the app, disable any antivirus software while downloading and installing as this could be falsely flagged as malware.
After installing, use the shortcut in the directory anywhere to launch the app.
